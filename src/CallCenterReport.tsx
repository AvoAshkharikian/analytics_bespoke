          During the analysis period, over {total.inbound} inbound calls were received. Approximately {total.answered} were successfully answered, while {total.abandoned} calls were abandoned and {total.missed} were missed. Average handle time held steady at {avgHandleTime} minutes.

          To manage the current call load efficiently, agents would need to collectively handle {totalMinutesNeeded.toFixed(0)} minutes of talk time. Based on weekday call averages and agent availability, we recommend a minimum of <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">{requiredAgents} full-time dedicated operators</span>. This accounts for overlapping call volume and prevents system bottlenecks.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Inbound Load:</strong> Weekly inbound calls exceed 1,000. Without corresponding staffing, response times suffer.</li>
          <li><strong>Missed/Abandoned Rates:</strong> Nearly 40â€“45% of calls are not answered live. This creates friction and hurts patient experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Staffing Need:</strong> With an average of ~{callsPerDay.toFixed(0)} weekday calls and handle times of {avgHandleTime} mins, 3 operators are needed to prevent call overlap and long wait times.</li>
          <li><strong>IVR System:</strong> High abandonment could indicate caller frustration or confusion with menu options. Consider simplifying prompts and reducing wait time.</li>
          <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Increase agent count, enhance IVR logic, and consider implementing call-backs or auto-routing based on department needs.</li>
