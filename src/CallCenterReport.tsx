          During the analysis period, over {total.inbound} inbound calls were received. Approximately {total.answered} were successfully answered, while {total.abandoned} calls were abandoned and {total.missed} were missed. Average handle time held steady at {avgHandleTime} minutes.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          To manage the current call load efficiently, agents would need to collectively handle {totalMinutesNeeded.toFixed(0)} minutes of talk time. With each agent only able to handle about 420 minutes per day, this translates to a minimum of <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">{requiredAgents} full-time dedicated operators</span>. Three agents are recommended to account for call concurrency and prevent overflow during peak periods.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Inbound Load:</strong> Weekly inbound calls exceed 1,000. Without corresponding staffing, response times suffer.</li>
          <li><strong>Missed/Abandoned Rates:</strong> Nearly 40â€“45% of calls are not answered live. This creates friction and hurts patient experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Staffing Need:</strong> With an average handle time of {avgHandleTime} minutes and available time of 420 minutes per agent, at least {requiredAgents} agents are needed. Three are recommended to handle concurrent calls.</li>
          <li><strong>IVR System:</strong> High abandonment could indicate caller frustration or confusion with menu options. Consider simplifying prompts and reducing wait time.</li>
          <li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Increase agent count, enhance IVR logic, and consider implementing call-backs or auto-routing based on department needs.</li>
